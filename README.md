# Emberscape

## 🔥 About the Project

Emberscape is a 2D pixel art platformer game - currently in development - where you play as a camper who must keep his campfire lit in order to survive. On top of this, the player must consume food to stay healthy all whilst gathering resources each night to keep the fire stoked. The player must survive as many nights as possible until they run out of fuel. This project showcases my skills in game development, pixel art creation, and programming in C# within the Godot engine environment as well as my competency in object oriented programming.
